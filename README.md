# ERC20-SURYTOKEN-

The complete code for an ERC-20 Token - Sury Token. Implements all the necessary functionality expressed in the ERC-20 Standard. I have written tests against the code and they have all passed. Sury Token is a robust smart contract. It does everything its expected to do! I used ganache, solodity and javascript technologies. 

ERC-20 is a standard that specifies how this token smart contract should work.
First, Sury Token smart contract keeps track of some basic token attributes. For example, it records the name, the symbol that you see on a cryptocurrency exchange, and how many total tokens exist. It also keeps track of who owns “My Token” and how much. ERC-20 tokens can be transferred from one account to another as payment, just like any other cryptocurrency.
They can also be purchased in a crowd sale, like an ICO.
